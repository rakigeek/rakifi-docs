## What is Raki Finance

Welcome to **Raki Finance**, the ultimate decentralized, all-in-one lending protocol on the Aptos platform. Our mission is to empower users to maximize their yield, points, and rewards through a seamless and versatile lending experience, setting a new standard in the DeFi landscape.

## Lending Pool Options

At Raki Finance, users can participate as both suppliers and borrowers, leveraging a variety of lending options tailored to their financial strategies. Our platform features three distinct types of lending pools:

1.  **Primary Pool**: Provide liquidity to the primary pool and earn a stable, passive income. This pool supports overcollateralized borrowing, ensuring the security and stability of the market, while rewarding participants with reliable returns.
2.  **Isolated Pool**: For those who prefer precise risk management, our isolated pools operate independently with specific collateral types and tailored risk parameters. This structure minimizes the impact of potential market volatility, offering a safer and more controlled environment for lenders and borrowers alike.
3.  **Leverage Pool**: Amplify your returns with up to 3x leverage on your collateral. The leverage pool is designed for users aiming to maximize their exposure to high-yield opportunities within the DeFi ecosystem, optimizing financial growth and potential rewards.

## Token Reward Mechanism
What sets Raki Finance apart is our innovative token reward mechanism. In addition to real yield earnings, both lenders and borrowers are rewarded with **RAKI** tokens for their participation. This dual-reward system enhances the value proposition, offering users additional incentives and further aligning their interests with the platform's growth and success.

## Staking and Wrapped Raki Tokens (wRaki)
Moreover, users who stake and lock their assets in our pools for a specified period can mint **wrapped Raki tokens (wRaki)**. These **wRaki** tokens unlock new opportunities within our secondary markets, allowing participants to engage in exciting activities such as prediction markets and airdrop markets. This feature not only provides additional utility for staked assets but also encourages long-term participation and engagement with the Raki Finance ecosystem.
